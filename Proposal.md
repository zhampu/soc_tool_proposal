## Station of Commons
### An ongoing Collaborative initiative by Gregoire Rousseau and Juan Gomez

Station of Commons  investigates **the possibilities of reappropiating technology within public space**. The point of departure of the research questions both centralized knowledge and data centers operated by major organizations and its underlying social implications. What are the interdependences between the users, the providers, the services, the technology and related knowledge at work? And how to rethink another model of shared empowerment situated in time and space unique to its agent, or communities?

A Station of Commons operates as easily integrable **on-line platform** for sharing local resources. Resources as commons integrate the ideas of shared data, **Open Source** practices, artefacts and real time broadcast. The sustainability of exchange, the ways they interoperate, the ecologies of interaction between the Stations of Commons produce provocations for a better collective understanding on how the Commons are in constant flux and also at risk.

Each Station depends on its own means of production, way of thinking, learning and sharing. This position of autonomy reflects on the original concept of Internet: the equality in the relation client to server and the openness of the algorithmic process. The Station of Commons operates as a vibrant thinking space dedicated for tutorials, live performances and critical discussions around the practice of commoning and open technologies.

## What is Station of Commons platform?
1. A agency of **artistic digital practices**, knowledge and know-how's to rethink means of production, communication and distribution using Open Source technology. The scope encompasses  sound art broadcast, formal work on-line visual content publishing, research on new forms of collaborative and social network.   
2. A space to for **discursive forms** with actors questioning commons and technology to represent a great diversity of knowledges and practices; architects, radical educator, media theorist, hacktivist, curators, musicians and artists exploring digital forms.
3. A series **Situated Tutorials** to provide both context and technical solutions for specific needs using open source technologies: create an audio server to broadcast over internet, create an local stream over Virtual Private Network, data migration from large scale private server to federated or community based platforms. 
4. Station of Commons provides technical guidance and support for **local communities** to implement related Open Technology needs and inquiries.
5. A Station of Commons operates as a **decentralized network** of nodes that uses Internet without its hegemonic agency.

## Subjects to explore
1. A reappropriation is never total, otherwise it would be a mere copy. The new production must modify, détourne, work with the subject matter. 
2. The research on material to use RaspberryPi with various Linux distribution, and open source software.
3. The visual narratives of tutorials as ways of sharing contextualized practical and theoretical concepts.
4. The "gentrification" of software production and their relationship to contemporary architectural narratives.

## Research Questions
1. How to think a temporally multi-dimensional space ? 
2. How to define the precise subject matter within technological space taken into account the different temporalities ?
4. What is a critical practice of digital space in terms of labor,relation to institutions, radical political position ?


## Communication plan

Station of commons explores the agency of shared information trough an event based temporality and considers the audience as knowledgeable passenger.
Station of commons will communicate on its live broadcasts, 2 weeks before their streaming and release tutorials on the same day of their publishing.They will be posted in following E-mail listings:
- our own international academic and profesional networks,
- Algolit
- Spectre
- NetTime

They will also be published in a dedicated channel in Mastodon social network and Twitter and from there re-posted in the personal social networks of our peers.

Mastodon: stationofcommons@mastodon.social

Twitter: https://twitter.com/sofcommons

We ask participating artists to promote the events by posting on their own social media accounts, FB, instagram...

## Project History / CV

Gregoire and Juan met during the UdK summer school 2019 in Berlin where the idea of Commons was very much brought forward in the context of architecture. We had the chance to exchange and discuss thoughts on the subject matter together with Stavros Stavrides (Architect, activist, and Professor at the School of Architecture, National Technical University of Athens, Greece) both within a collective and later on at the personal relation level. We learned that concrete social realities manifests and unfold their potentialities within their spaces of activities. Political subjectivation operates together with spatial transformations, and the practice of Commoning as means of reappropiation. As the discussion developed,  we could not help thinking: what if the space would not be situated in the framework of architecture but in the context of technology within society, what if commoning technology would operate as a mean of emancipation by reappropriation of the algorithm ?
This moment was the original spark for Station of Commons; an inquiry on the possibilities of technology and its reappropiation within public space

Juan Gomez:
Juan is a media artist and interaction designer who lives and works in Geneva,Switzerland. He graduated with honours from the Haute école d’art et de design – Genève (HEAD – Geneva) and is working in the intersection between art and design. He organizes workshops on critical technology, curates panels on contemporary publishing practices and conceives interactive installations with programing tools he develops. 
His current interest are: The materialisation of social technologies in temporal urban spaces and their potential for generating valuable discussions in urban decisions; On empowering methods for the civil society to engage with their technological tools and on inclusive ways for teaching coding in playful ways.

Grégoire Rousseau:
Grégoire is artist and educator based between Helsinki and Paris. He is graduated both as Electrical Engineer and Master of Fine Arts.  His artistic work questions the role of the machine, the algorithm within the digitally controlled society, and the complexity of the neo-liberal interests in relation to public knowledge, to commons within technological space. Beside artist practice, Rousseau has been teaching in Finnish Academy of Fine Arts for ten years where he developed and implemented the first space dedicated to technology in 2013. He regularly lectures on art within the technological space; Aalto university, ENSBA Paris, French Institute in Finland, CAC Shanghai.
In 2001, he founded electronic music record label Tuulanauhat; in 2014, he co-founded Rabrab Press with Sezgin Boynik, Journal for Political and Formal Inquiries in Arts. In 2018, he authored the publication “Learning from electric energy in the arts, Knowledge happens together”; in 2020 he initiated Station of Commons a platform of commoning practices within technological space.
