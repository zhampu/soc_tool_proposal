# Station of Commons
### An ongoing Collaborative initiative by Gregoire Rousseau and Juan Gomez

Adding text

Station of Commons  investigates the possibilities of technology and its reappropiation within public space.  The point of departure of the research questions both centralized knowledge and data centers operated by major organizations and its underlying social implications.  What are the interdependences between the users, the providers, the services, the technology and related knowledge at work? And how to rethink another model of shared empowerment  situated in time and space unique to its actor.  A Station of Commons operates as easily integrable on-line platform for sharing local resources.  Resources as commons integrate the ideas of shared data, open source practices, artefacts and real time broadcast.  The sustainability of exchange, the ways they interoperate, the ecologies of interaction between the Stations of Commons produce provocations for a better collective understanding on how the Commons are in constant flux and also at risk.

A Station of Commons connects and communicates with other Stations of Commons over Internet without its hegemonic agency.  Internet infrastructure serves only as practical protocol of communication between stations and not a centralized server concentrating and accumulating power.   Each Station depends on its own means of production, way of thinking, learning and sharing.  This position of autonomy reflects on the original concept of Internet: the equality in the relation client to server and the openness of the algorithmic process. The exhibition operates as a vibrant thinking space dedicated for workshops, performances and critical discussions around the practice of commoning and open technologies.

## Project History

In 2019, Juan Gomez presented a master thesis for the Master Media Design at HEAD - Genève titled: “Hybrid Public Spaces: The Right to the Hybrid City”, In which he explored the idea of using technological means to experiment new participatory methods for the population in Switzerland. This project was followed up by Decisions Architecture project mentored by Gordan Savičić and Dominic Robson.

Gregoire and Juan met during the UdK summer school 2019 in Berlin where the idea of Commons was very much brought forward in the context of architecture. We had the chance to exchange and discuss thoughts on the subject matter together with Stavros Stavrides (Architect, activist, and Professor at the School of Architecture, National Technical University of Athens, Greece) both within a collective and later on at the personal relation level. We learned that concrete social realities manifests and unfold their potentialities within their spaces of activities. Political subjectivation operates together with spatial transformations, and the practice of Commoning as means of reappropiation. 

As the discussion developed,  we could not help thinking: what if the space would not be situated in the framework of architecture but in the context of technology within society, what if commoning technology would operate as a mean of emancipation by reappropriation of the algorithm ?
This moment was the original spark for Station of Commons; an inquiry on the possibilities of technology and its reappropiation within public space

We realized then that an operative space would match the definition for a station:

1. A situated space for arrival and departure
2. A specific location connected to other locations by a transparent network
3. Operates within specific set of technologies 
4. An agency of shared information
5. Event based temporality
6. Audience as knowledgeable passengers

## Subjects to explore

1. The technology as a space for data storing, data processing, data broadcast, to produce respectively an space of knowledge, a performative space, a social space.

2. The research on material or equipment was simple as we use RaspberryPi with various Linux distribution, the open source community provides repositories to support our goals; free and open source, easy to use and monitor, networking tools, multimedia possibility, programming languages, General Purpose Input Output, security, ease to impement with Arduino or any other digitally connected interface such as MIDI, DMX or self design devices.  The raspberryPi can both process and broadcast data; this aspect is very important for performance being sound or panel talk.

3. Even if the project just starts, we would like to note that the process of realization would not have advanced that far if we would not have heard encouragements from other colleagues and art related public institutions. In that sense, our initiative works to trigger interest.

4. Difficulties to translate architecture/space related concepts into art and technology.

5. A reappropriation is never total, otherwise it would be a mere copy. The new production must modify, détourne, work with the subject matter. 

6. “Technology suggests the hand...” Quinn Latimer documenta14 reader.  The technological space operates as a platform to develop a new practice of 
commoning by “using the hand” on technology to produce a new discourse on open and public technology. 

7. Panel talks with other actors questioning commons and technology.

## Research Questions

We are still in the early phase of development, However, departing from our wide notion, or already concept, to produce a research on what may be the position of technology within the framework of Commoning and reappropiation of space, we had to face, and engage with the following questions:

1. How to think a temporally multi-dimensional space ? 
2. How to define the precise subject matter within technological space taken into account the different temporalities ?
3. How to frame the material requirement of the technological space ?
4. What is a critical practice of digital space in terms of labor, in terms of relation to institutions, in terms of radical political position ?
5. And when communication over digital networks are permanently available, or event based in relation to art context ?
6. What implies temporality in Commoning, specifically when communities operate on-line ?
