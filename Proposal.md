# Station of Commons
### An ongoing Collaborative initiative by Gregoire Rousseau and Juan Gomez

Station of Commons  investigates the possibilities of **reappropiating technology within public space**. The point of departure of the research questions both centralized knowledge and data centers operated by major organizations and its underlying social implications. What are the interdependences between the users, the providers, the services, the technology and related knowledge at work? And how to rethink another model of shared empowerment situated in time and space unique to its agent, or communities?

A Station of Commons operates as easily integrable **on-line platform** for sharing local resources. Resources as commons integrate the ideas of shared data, **Open Source** practices, artefacts and real time broadcast. The sustainability of exchange, the ways they interoperate, the ecologies of interaction between the Stations of Commons produce provocations for a better collective understanding on how the Commons are in constant flux and also at risk.

Each Station depends on its own means of production, way of thinking, learning and sharing. This position of autonomy reflects on the original concept of Internet: the equality in the relation client to server and the openness of the algorithmic process. The Station of Commons operates as a vibrant thinking space dedicated for tutorials, live performances and critical discussions around the practice of commoning and open technologies.

## What is Station of Commons platform?
1. A agency of **digital practices**, knowledge and know-how's to rethink means of production, communication and distribution using Open Source technology. 
2. A space to for **discursive forms** with actors questioning commons and technology to represent a great diversity of knowledges and practices; architects, radical educator, media theorist, hacktivist, curators, musicians and artists exploring digital forms.
3. A series **Situated Tutorials** to provide both context and technical solutions for specific needs using open source technologies: create an audio server to broadcast over internet, create an local stream over Virtual Private Network, data migration from large scale private server to federated or community based platforms. 
4. Station of Commons provides technical guidance and support for **local communities** to implement related Open Technology needs and inquiries.
5. A Station of Commons operates as a **decentralized network** of nodes that uses Internet without its hegemonic agency.

## Subjects to explore
1. A reappropriation is never total, otherwise it would be a mere copy. The new production must modify, dÃ©tourne, work with the subject matter. 
2. The research on material or equipment was simple as we use RaspberryPi with various Linux distribution, the open source community provides repositories to support our goals; free and open source, easy to use and monitor, networking tools, multimedia possibility, programming languages, General Purpose Input Output, security, ease to impement with Arduino or any other digitally connected interface such as MIDI, DMX or self design devices.  The raspberryPi can both process and broadcast data; this aspect is very important for performance being sound or panel talk.
3. Difficulties to translate architecture/space related concepts into art and technology.
4. The interdependant qualities of virtual and physical spaces and how are they interwinned 
5. The visual narratives of tutorials as ways of sharing contextualized practical and theoretical concepts.
6. The gentrification of software production and their relationship to contemporary architectural narratives.

## Research Questions

1. How to think a temporally multi-dimensional space ? 
2. How to define the precise subject matter within technological space taken into account the different temporalities ?
3. How to frame the material requirement of the technological space ?
4. What is a critical practice of digital space in terms of labor, in terms of relation to institutions, in terms of radical political position ?
5. And when communication over digital networks are permanently available, or event based in relation to art context ?
6. What implies temporality in Commoning, specifically when communities operate on-line?


## Communication plan

- Use Mastodon federated network 
- The instagram channel of peers

## Project History

Gregoire and Juan met during the UdK summer school 2019 in Berlin where the idea of Commons was very much brought forward in the context of architecture. We had the chance to exchange and discuss thoughts on the subject matter together with Stavros Stavrides (Architect, activist, and Professor at the School of Architecture, National Technical University of Athens, Greece) both within a collective and later on at the personal relation level. We learned that concrete social realities manifests and unfold their potentialities within their spaces of activities. Political subjectivation operates together with spatial transformations, and the practice of Commoning as means of reappropiation.As the discussion developed,  we could not help thinking: what if the space would not be situated in the framework of architecture but in the context of technology within society, what if commoning technology would operate as a mean of emancipation by reappropriation of the algorithm ?
This moment was the original spark for Station of Commons; an inquiry on the possibilities of technology and its reappropiation within public space

## Budget

1. Further the develop the existant web platform [Stationofcommons.org](Stationofcommons.org)
2. Design and develop a page of tutorials for installing open source tools
3. Design and develop a page of long read that elaborate on the subjects to explore
4. Development on the diversity of possible hardware connectivity with audio server. 
5. Support for other community to implement their own Station server.
6. contributors fee
